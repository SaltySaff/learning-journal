                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made 
                    the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects 
                    projects and meet like-minded peers.

                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
                        and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned
                        or work new techniques into existing projects. While that was fun, I felt 
                        like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about
                        my journey with the world.

                        How I got started
                    </h3>
                    <p class="blog-content-text">
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take 
                        notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes 
                        to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
                        learned using my own words. That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized
                        that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
